Sinatra TODO
Writing a TODO list has become the new "Hello World!" for the web. Use Sinatra to implement one of this applications

Write a small application that allows us to add tasks to a list
Clicking over a task should mark it as done
Once done we should be able to delete a task
The date of creation should be shown together with the task
If the task contains the word urgent the task will become the most prioritary
The task list should be saved in a file so we can restart the application and the tasks should persist.
